Our open source project would be an open source inventory solution much like SAP. In order to create revenue for our project, we would offer a support subscription. Once subscribed to our support subscription, we would assist companies in customizing our solution to their specific needs as well as providing technical support for users within those organizations. This would be advantageous for larger companies that need a more specific and managed solution, and would allow other companies who want to self manage to use it free of charge. We decided on a GPLv3 license because it would allow companies to use it for free as well as modify it, but it would not allow another company to steal it and sell it without disclosing the source (they must release it as open source). Therefore anyone selling a version of our software can't pretend as if our source code is a unique proprietary solution.
